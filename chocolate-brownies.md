# Double chocolate brownies

The secret of good brownies is to be generous with the chocolate and avoid over-baking because it dries them out. A great tip for really neat squares is waiting to cut them until the following day.

Prepare: 15 minutes
Cook: 30 minutes
Makes: 20 squares

## Ingredients

- 225g salted butter, plus extra to grease
- 200g plain chocolate
- 4 medium eggs
- 325g light brown sugar
- 100g plain flour
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- 200g chocolate chips (white, milk, or both)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Grease a small tin measuring about 26x22cm or similar. Cut a large rectangle of greaseproof paper and press it into the tin, snipping the paper at the corners so it fits neatly. Grease the paper.
2. Break the plain chocolate into pieces and place in a heatproof bowl. Cut the butter into chunks and place on top. Microwave for 20 second bursts, stirring in between, until fully melted and smooth.
3. In another bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer for about 3 minutes until pale and foamy. Stir in the melted chocolate and butter mixture. Sift the flour and cocoa powder into the bowl and stir in gently. Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chips, before pouring into the tin.
4. Bake for about 30 minutes or until a sugary, cracked crust has formed. It should wobble slightly when the tin is shaken. Leave to cool completely in the tin before cutting into pieces.
